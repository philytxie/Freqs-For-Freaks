"""
FREQUENCY HEARING CHALLENGE
Simple script for training your perfect pitch in terms of frequencies too


Piano range for reference:
- min = A0 = 27.50 Hz
- max = C8 = 4186.01 Hz


Functionality:
- play random note automatically
- type r to repeat
- type to guess frequency
    - calculate octave error (remember freqs are log scale)
- gamify:
    - over 5 trials, computes the average octave error
    - may roast you if you do badly


Phil's current high score over 5 rounds is 0.015
